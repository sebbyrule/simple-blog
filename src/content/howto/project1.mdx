# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

## Why Next.js?

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Improves initial page load time and SEO.
2. **Static Site Generation**: Great for content-heavy websites like blogs.
3. **API Routes**: Easily create API endpoints as part of your Next.js app.

Here's a simple example of a Next.js page:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    
      Welcome to My Next.js Blog
      This is a simple example of a Next.js page component.
    
  )
}
```
